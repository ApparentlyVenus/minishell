# SYNTAX:
#
#   rulename    ::= defintion
#   rules       -> lowercase
#   token       -> uppercase

input       ::= pipeline
pipeline    ::= command ('|' pipeline)?

# the question mark means its optional:
# a pipeline might contain a pipe 
# and another pipeline, or it might not

command     ::= WORD+ redir* | redir+

# here the (*) means there might be zero or more words
# and the (+) means there must be at least 1 word
# example:  ls -l /etc  -> 3 words
#           echo hello  -> 2 words
#           < file.txt  -> 0 words it's just a redir

# when parsing the command we have to make sure to implement left assosiative parsing
# this means that when parsing a | b | c, th strcuture needs to be (a | b) | c and not a | (b | c)

redir       ::= ('<'|'>'|'>>'|'<<') WORD

# RECURSIVE DESCENT METHOD:
#
#   -> top down parsing methodology:
#   -> each rule has its own function (pase_pipeline, parse_input, ect..)
#   -> each function will call the functions defined in it
#   -> example:     parse_pipeline 
#                       |
#                       |-> parse_command -> parse_redir
#                       |-> parse_pipeline
#                               |
#                               |-> parse_command -> parse_redir
