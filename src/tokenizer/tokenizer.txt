1. Redirection Validation:

Examples of invalid input:

Consecutive redirections: ls > > file

Missing filename: ls >, ls <

Mixed redirections: ls >> << file

Redirects without command: < > file

2. Heredoc Validation:

Invalid forms:

Chained heredocs: << EOF <<

Missing delimiter: << or <<

3. Logical Operator Validation (if implemented):

Trailing or leading: ls &&, && ls

Double ops: ls && && pwd

Mixed with pipe: ls | && pwd

4. Quote Validation:

Unclosed or mismatched quotes:

'unclosed, "unclosed, 'mixed"

🛠️ Code Improvements

1. Enhanced Error Handling:

Use an enum like t_parse_error to report specific parsing issues.

2. Tokenizer Validation Enhancements:

Add a t_tokenizer_state struct to track:

Quote states

Pipe counts

Redirect expectations

3. Improved Memory Management:

Central cleanup_parse_state() to clean all partially allocated structures.

4. Parser State Validation:

Detect empty commands and invalid redirection chains.

5. Wildcard Handling:

Validate use of * based on your rules:

Accept: echo *

Possibly reject: echo **, echo * *

✅ Recommended Validation Flow
Tokenization Phase:
Handle quotes, basic structure.

Post-Tokenization:
Validate semantics (e.g., >> <<, && &&).

Parse Phase:
Ensure proper command formation and structure.

⚠️ Error Recovery Strategy
Instead of returning NULL on error, return a special error node with a message.

This allows the shell to continue parsing and provide better feedback.
